KiCad Docs Website Source
====================

Docs website source for kicad :D


== Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.3 or higher
- Bundle


== Getting started
After cloning the project, run

----
bundle install
---- 

to download the required ruby packages.

Basic development can then be done by 

----
jekyll serve

== Docs themselves
The build process itself will automate retrieving the docs and staging them in the correct folders.
For devleopment purposes, you will want to take the build output of the kicad-doc cmake process and put it into the 
/src/ folder. i.e. take your /build/ folder from kicad-doc and put in the tree as /src/ here.

Then run

----
rake process_files
----

which will then do its thing taking the kicad-doc output and adjusting it for final inclusion in the website.
